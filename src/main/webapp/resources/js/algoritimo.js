Cruise ship doctor Nic Joshi is drinking himself into oblivion as as he mourns his wife, Jen, who was killed after discovering a black market in organ transplants. When a passenger named Jess seeks him out, he refuses to believe her story: She received Jen's heart, and she has a message for him. <em>A Change of Heart</em> is part thriller, part romance and part magical possibility, with a deeply satisfying and several-tissues-required happy ending.",
